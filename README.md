# Obedience API
Documentation for the API of Obedience.

## Beta version
This API is in beta. Breaking changes to the API can (at this point) be made at any time. You'll be able to find up-to-date information here.

## Setup
To start, your extension needs to request the Obedience user's permission to connect to their account and access their data.
